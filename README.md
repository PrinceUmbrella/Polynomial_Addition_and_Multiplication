# Polynomial_Addition_and_Multiplication
Polynomial Add( const Polynomial, const Polynomial );  // adds two polynomials and returns a polynomial which is the sum of these two polynomials. 

Polynomial Multiply( const Polynomial, const Polynomial );  // multiplies two polynomials and returns a polynomial which is the product of these two polynomials. 

For simplicity, you can assume the following in the input format: 
 
1. Coefficients and exponents are within the range of int type integers.  Therefore you donâ€™t need to call the function that you did in assignment 4 to handle values outside the int range.   This means that the value can be positive or negative. 
 
2. The polynomial is input in the format of decreasing order of exponent, with like-terms combined already.   Your result should be output in the same format in decreasing order of exponent of the terms, with all like-terms combined.
